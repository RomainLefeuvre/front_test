      - generic [ref=e40]:
        - heading "Research Methodology" [level=3] [ref=e41]
        - paragraph [ref=e42]: This vulnerability lookup system is based on research from the paper "Chasing One-Day Vulnerabilities", which investigates how security vulnerabilities propagate through forked repositories rather than traditional dependency chains.
        - heading "Commit-Level Vulnerability Tracking" [level=3] [ref=e43]
        - paragraph [ref=e44]: Unlike traditional vulnerability databases that track vulnerabilities at the package or project level, this system tracks vulnerabilities at the commit level. Each vulnerability is associated with specific commits in the Software Heritage archive, enabling precise identification of when and where a vulnerability was introduced or fixed.
        - paragraph [ref=e45]: This commit-level granularity allows us to trace vulnerabilities across the entire fork network, identifying repositories that may have inherited vulnerable code through forking but never received the corresponding security patches.
        - heading "Fork-Based Vulnerability Propagation" [level=3] [ref=e46]
        - paragraph [ref=e47]: When developers fork a repository, they create a snapshot of the code at that point in time. If the original repository later receives a security patch, that fix does not automatically propagate to forks. This creates "one-day vulnerabilities" - vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and patched in the original project but remain unpatched in forks.

        - list [ref=e76]:

          - listitem [ref=e79]: "Cherry-pick Analysis: Commit tracking to identify security patches and their propagation"
        - paragraph [ref=e81]: "Note: This is a research tool designed to help maintainers identify potential security issues in forked repositories. The presence of a vulnerability in this database indicates that a vulnerable commit exists in the fork's history, but does not necessarily mean the current version is vulnerable. Always verify findings and consult the detailed CVE information before taking action."
